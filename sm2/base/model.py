        1-d endogenous response variable. The dependent variable.
    exog : array-like
        A nobs x k array where `nobs` is the number of observations and `k`
        is the number of regressors. An intercept is not included by default
        and should be added by the user. See

    missing : str
        Available options are 'none', 'drop', and 'raise'. If 'none', no nan
        checking is done. If 'drop', any observations with nans are dropped.
        If 'raise', an error is raised. Default is 'none.'"""

    hasconst : None or bool
        Indicates whether the RHS includes a user-supplied constant. If True,
        a constant is not checked for and k_constant is set to 1 and all
        result statistics are calculated as if a constant is present. If
        False, a constant is not checked for and k_constant is set to 0.
