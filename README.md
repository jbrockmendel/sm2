sm2
---
[statsmodels](https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels) is an excellent
project and important part of the python scientific stack.  But due to resource
constraints, they cannot push out bugfixes often enough for my tastes.  sm2
is a fork focused on bugfixes and addressing technical debt.

Ideally sm2 will be a drop-in replacement for statsmodels.  In places where
this fails, feel free to open an issue.

With luck, fixes made here will eventually be ported upstream.
